## Security Requirements Addressed

This implementation addresses the following security requirements:

- **24.1**: 24/7 security event monitoring ✅
- **24.2**: Real-time threat detection and analysis ✅
- **24.6**: Security dashboard with threat visualization ✅
- **22.1**: Automated threat containment procedures ✅
- **22.2**: Incident classification and prioritization ✅
- **22.4**: Incident escalation and notification procedures ✅
- **22.3**: Digital forensics data collection ✅
- **22.5**: Attack timeline reconstruction ✅
- **22.6**: Threat attribution and analysis ✅

## Integration Points

### With Existing Security Components
- **Threat Detection Engine**: Receives threat detection events for processing
- **Audit Service**: Creates comprehensive audit trails for all security activities
- **Security Manager**: Integrates with overall security management framework

### With Core System
- **Logging System**: Utilizes structured logging for security events
- **Configuration Management**: Supports configurable security policies and thresholds
- **Event System**: Uses EventEmitter pattern for loose coupling and extensibility

## Configuration

Each service supports comprehensive configuration options:

```typescript
// Example configuration for Security Monitoring Service
const config = {
  monitoringInterval: 5000, // 5 seconds
  correlationWindow: 300000, // 5 minutes
  maxEventHistory: 10000,
  alertThresholds: {
    criticalThreatScore: 9,
    highThreatScore: 7,
    mediumThreatScore: 5,
    eventVelocityThreshold: 100
  },
  dashboardRefreshInterval: 10000, // 10 seconds
  metricsInterval: 60000 // 1 minute
};
```

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { securityMonitoringService } from '@/security/security-monitoring-service';
import { incidentResponseService } from '@/security/incident-response-service';
import { forensicAnalysisService } from '@/security/forensic-analysis-service';

// Start security monitoring
await securityMonitoringService.startMonitoring();

// Start incident response
await incidentResponseService.startIncidentResponse();

// Start forensic analysis
await forensicAnalysisService.startForensicAnalysis();

// The services will automatically handle security events and incidents
```

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

The system is designed with legal compliance in mind:

- **Chain of custody** management for all forensic evidence
- **Digital signatures** for evidence integrity verification
- **Comprehensive audit trails** for all security activities
- **Configurable retention policies** for compliance requirements
- **Legal hold capabilities** for litigation support

## Performance and Scalability

- **Efficient event processing** with configurable batch sizes
- **Memory management** with automatic cleanup of old data
- **Configurable retention periods** to balance storage and compliance
- **Asynchronous processing** to prevent blocking operations
- **Metrics collection** for performance monitoring and optimization

## Security Considerations

- **Encrypted evidence storage** with integrity verification
- **Secure key management** for digital signatures
- **Access control** for sensitive security data
- **Audit logging** for all security operations
- **Threat isolation** capabilities to prevent lateral movement

This comprehensive security monitoring and incident response system provides enterprise-grade security capabilities for the AI Crypto Trading Agent, ensuring robust protection of trading capital and system integrity.
